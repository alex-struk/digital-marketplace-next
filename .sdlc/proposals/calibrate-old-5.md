# 22 criterion(s) fail against old: which of them is the application's fault, which the spec's, and which the test's?

**Recommendation.** Rule on R-1.1, R-2.2, R-4.5, R-1.8, R-4.9, R-7.9, R-4.12, R-7.12, R-6.17, R-3.18, R-4.19, R-7.20, R-5.22, R-7.22, R-1.24, R-7.25, R-3.27, R-4.27, R-7.27, R-1.35, R-2.35, R-1.53 with a calibration condition, so the next calibrate run can apply it.

22 criterion(s) failed against the **old** target at http://localhost:3000, with no ruling yet.
The tests are blind: they were written from the criteria alone, by an agent that never saw the
application. So a failure means one of exactly three things, and only you can say which:
the application is wrong, the criterion is wrong, or the test is wrong.

Rule on each one below. Until every failure carries a ruling, this question is asked again on
every calibration run.

### R-1.53 · v2

An opportunity may be deleted only while it is a draft or under review: an administrator may delete one in either state, and the public sector employee who created it may delete it only while it is a draft. The same rule governs Code With Us, Sprint With Us and Team With Us alike, and any other request to delete is refused and the opportunity remains.

- given: an opportunity that has been published at any point
- when: anyone asks to delete it
- then: the request is refused and the opportunity remains
- test: tests/acceptance/opportunities/R-1.53.spec.ts

## Calibration conditions

One condition per line, and exactly one of these forms:

- `defect-in-old <ID>` — the old application really does fail this and the criterion is right
  anyway. The test stands as written and the rebuild has to pass it; the criterion keeps a note
  saying so. No text after the ID.
- `spec-wrong <ID>: <corrected statement>` — the criterion misdescribes what the old application
  does. The statement is replaced and its version bumped, which marks the test stale so
  `derive-tests --stale` writes it again from the corrected criterion.
- `test-wrong <ID>: <why>` — the criterion is right and the test is not. The id goes to
  `tests/acceptance/redo.yaml` for `derive-tests` to redo, still blind, and `<why>` records what
  the test got wrong without describing how the application is built.

The ID is the criterion's own id exactly as `spec/criteria-index.json` spells it. `defect-in-old`
takes no text; the other two require a colon and text on the same line. A condition may not span
more than one line.
