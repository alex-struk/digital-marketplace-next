# 26 criterion(s) fail against old: which of them is the application's fault, which the spec's, and which the test's?

**Recommendation.** Rule on R-1.1, R-5.1, R-1.3, R-3.3, R-4.5, R-5.9, R-1.10, R-1.11, R-1.12, R-3.12, R-2.13, R-3.13, R-1.14, R-1.17, R-3.19, R-5.19, R-8.19, R-1.21, R-3.22, R-6.23, R-1.24, R-5.24, R-5.25, R-3.28, R-1.39, R-1.55 with a calibration condition, so the next calibrate run can apply it.

26 criterion(s) failed against the **old** target at http://localhost:3000, with no ruling yet.
The tests are blind: they were written from the criteria alone, by an agent that never saw the
application. So a failure means one of exactly three things, and only you can say which:
the application is wrong, the criterion is wrong, or the test is wrong.

Rule on each one below. Until every failure carries a ruling, this question is asked again on
every calibration run.

### R-1.1 · v2

### R-3.28 · v1

Only an administrator may set which service areas an organization is approved for, and saving a selection replaces the organization's previous approvals entirely.

- given: an organization approved for two service areas
- when: an administrator edits the service areas, leaves one of the two ticked, ticks a third, and saves
- then: the organization is approved for exactly the two areas that were ticked and no longer for the one that was cleared, and the same page offers no editing control to the organization's own owner
- test: tests/acceptance/organizations/R-3.28.spec.ts

### R-1.39 · v1

The opportunity list can be narrowed by program, by state, to remote-friendly opportunities only, and by free text matched against title and location.

- when: someone selects a program, selects a state, ticks remote-only, or types words into the search box
- then: only opportunities matching every chosen condition remain visible
- test: tests/acceptance/opportunities/R-1.39.spec.ts

### R-1.55 · v1

A Sprint With Us or Team With Us opportunity must name an evaluation panel of at least two distinct public sector employees, exactly one of whom is the chair; a submission with fewer than two members, the same person twice, no chair, more than one chair, or anyone who is not a public sector employee is rejected and the reason is named.

- test: tests/acceptance/opportunities/R-1.55.spec.ts

## Calibration conditions

One condition per line, and exactly one of these forms:

- `defect-in-old <ID>` — the old application really does fail this and the criterion is right
  anyway. The test stands as written and the rebuild has to pass it; the criterion keeps a note
  saying so. No text after the ID.
- `spec-wrong <ID>: <corrected statement>` — the criterion misdescribes what the old application
  does. The statement is replaced and its version bumped, which marks the test stale so
  `derive-tests --stale` writes it again from the corrected criterion.
- `test-wrong <ID>: <why>` — the criterion is right and the test is not. The id goes to
  `tests/acceptance/redo.yaml` for `derive-tests` to redo, still blind, and `<why>` records what
  the test got wrong without describing how the application is built.

The ID is the criterion's own id exactly as `spec/criteria-index.json` spells it. `defect-in-old`
takes no text; the other two require a colon and text on the same line. A condition may not span
more than one line.
