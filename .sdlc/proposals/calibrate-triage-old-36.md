# 2 criterion(s) fail against old: which of them did this project's own adapter cause?

**Recommendation.** Sort R-1.17, R-8.29 with a triage condition each, so the adapter's failures are fixed there and only product questions reach the product owner.

2 criterion(s) failed against the **old** target at http://localhost:4300, and nobody has sorted them yet.
Before any reaches the product owner, say which of them this project's own adapter caused. The adapter is
under `tests/adapters/old/`; read each one against it and against the test.

### R-1.17 · v2

Each evaluation question on a Sprint With Us or Team With Us opportunity carries a question and a guideline of 1 to 1,000 characters, a maximum score of at least 1, a response word limit of 1 to 3,000, and an optional minimum score that must be lower than the maximum score; its position is set by its place in the opportunity's list of questions, which holds at most 100, and is never entered by the person; a question outside these limits is refused.

- given: a member of public sector staff adding an evaluation question to an opportunity
- when: they submit a question or guideline outside 1 to 1,000 characters, a score below 1, a word limit outside 1 to 3,000, a position outside 0 to 100, or a minimum score equal to or above the question's score
- then: the submission is rejected and the offending field is named
- test: tests/acceptance/opportunities/R-1.17.spec.ts

### R-8.29 · v1

An image placed into a piece of formatted text is stored as an ordinary file marked readable by anyone, and the text refers to it by an internal marker that is turned into a download address only when the text is displayed.

- given: an administrator editing a page's body with the image control
- when: they choose an image and it is accepted
- then: the image is inserted into the text as a reference the service resolves for itself, and a reader of the finished page sees the image
- test: tests/acceptance/files/R-8.29.spec.ts

## Triage conditions

One condition per line, one for every criterion the page lists, in exactly one of these forms:

- `adapter-wrong <ID>: <why>` — the criterion and the test are both fine, and this target's adapter
  is what failed: it read the wrong thing off the page, reported a control missing that the page
  does render, or answered empty where it never reached the page. `<why>` names what the adapter
  did wrong, specifically enough for the next binding run to fix it. The criterion is not touched.
  On an unbound row it sends the binding back to `bind-adapter` however often it has been sent.
- `product-question <ID>` — nothing in the evidence points at the adapter. The failure goes to the
  product owner, who decides whether the application, the criterion or the test is wrong. No text
  after the ID. On an unbound row, use it when the criterion itself looks suspect.
- `oracle-cannot <ID>: <why>` — only for a row listed as unbound, on the oracle's target: the
  oracle genuinely cannot be driven into, or observed in, the state the test needs without
  changing its code — the state sits behind an external identity provider, is reachable only
  through a link the application emails, or is enforced only by a browser-native dialog.
  `<why>` names that state and why the oracle cannot reach it. It closes the row, changes no
  criterion, and stands until the criterion's version changes. It is never a way to skip binding
  work: where the application offers the control under another label, behind a step or as
  another persona, the answer is `adapter-wrong`.

The ID is the criterion's own id exactly as `spec/criteria-index.json` spells it. A condition may
not span more than one line. When the evidence is genuinely unclear, it is a `product-question`:
a failure wrongly sent to the product owner is answered there, while one wrongly blamed on the
adapter comes back from the next binding run unchanged and costs a run to find out.


## Ruling

**Verdict:** approve
**By:** agent:reviewer
**Ruled on:** claude claude-opus-5-5 (2.1.284 (Claude Code))

The question is which of R-1.17 and R-8.29's failures against old were caused by this project's adapter. Approved with one triage condition each. R-1.17: in all ten cases the adapter's saveDraft completed, and saveDraft (index.ts:2435) throws through mustLandOn unless the browser lands on the saved opportunity's address. So the old app accepted every draft carrying an out-of-limit question, including a 101st. fieldError (index.ts:2463) then went through every step of the saved form and found nothing. The adapter misread nothing: the app took a draft the criterion says it should refuse, and whether the refusal belongs at draft save or only at submit/publish is the product owner's question. R-8.29: the error shows an empty string from a toBeTruthy check with no line. The prime suspect is fileEmbeddedImage.imageRenderedInPublishedText (index.ts:9167). It lists the page's images immediately after contentView.open without the ready() wait that pageTitle and pageBody on the same page call first (index.ts:8415-8424), so it can read the page before it has drawn and return ''. That is the adapter answering empty where it never reached the page. Earlier rounds have already sent this test's path back to the adapter three times. The failing line was not confirmed by a rerun, because the target could not be reached from this session. What would change the ruling: a rerun showing R-8.29's empty value comes from readableWhenSignedOutIfPublic or fileContents on a drawn page, which would make it a product-question; or evidence that the old app refuses the draft and the adapter misses the refusal, which would make R-1.17 adapter-wrong.

**Conditions:**
- product-question R-1.17
- adapter-wrong R-8.29: fileEmbeddedImage.imageRenderedInPublishedText collects img src attributes immediately after contentView.open without first calling ready() (as contentView.pageTitle and pageBody on the same /content/:slug page do), so it can read the page before it draws and return ''. Wait for the page to finish drawing, then wait a few seconds for an img whose src carries the /api/files/<id> the body's FILE_ID marker names; if none appears, throw an error naming the sources the page does show, rather than returning ''.
