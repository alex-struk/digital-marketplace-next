# 1 criterion(s) fail against old: which of them is the application's fault, which the spec's, and which the test's?

**Recommendation.** Rule on R-1.17 with a calibration condition, so the next calibrate run can apply it.

1 criterion(s) failed against the **old** target at http://localhost:4300, with no ruling yet.
The tests are blind: they were written from the criteria alone, by an agent that never saw the
application. So a failure means one of exactly three things, and only you can say which:
the application is wrong, the criterion is wrong, or the test is wrong.

Rule on each one below. Until every failure carries a ruling, this question is asked again on
every calibration run.

### R-1.17 · v3

Each evaluation question on a Sprint With Us or Team With Us opportunity carries a question and a guideline of 1 to 1,000 characters, a maximum score of at least 1, a response word limit of 1 to 3,000, and an optional minimum score that must be lower than the maximum score; its position (0 to 100) is set by its place in the opportunity's list of questions and is never entered by the person. These limits are enforced when the opportunity is submitted for review or published, where a question outside them is refused and the offending field is named; saving the opportunity as a draft does not apply them, so a draft may be saved holding a question outside these limits.

- given: a member of public sector staff adding an evaluation question to an opportunity
- when: they submit a question or guideline outside 1 to 1,000 characters, a score below 1, a word limit outside 1 to 3,000, a position outside 0 to 100, or a minimum score equal to or above the question's score
- then: the submission is rejected and the offending field is named
- test: tests/acceptance/opportunities/R-1.17.spec.ts

## Calibration conditions

One condition per line, and exactly one of these forms:

- `defect-in-old <ID>` — the old application really does fail this and the criterion is right
  anyway. The test stands as written and the rebuild has to pass it; the criterion keeps a note
  saying so. No text after the ID.
- `spec-wrong <ID>: <corrected statement>` — the criterion misdescribes what the old application
  does. The statement is replaced and its version bumped, which marks the test stale so
  `derive-tests --stale` writes it again from the corrected criterion.
- `test-wrong <ID>: <why>` — the criterion is right and the test is not. The id goes to
  `tests/acceptance/redo.yaml` for `derive-tests` to redo, still blind, and `<why>` records what
  the test got wrong without describing how the application is built.

The ID is the criterion's own id exactly as `spec/criteria-index.json` spells it. `defect-in-old`
takes no text; the other two require a colon and text on the same line. A condition may not span
more than one line.
