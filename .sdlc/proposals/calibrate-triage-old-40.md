# 4 criterion(s) fail against old: which of them did this project's own adapter cause?

**Recommendation.** Sort R-1.10, R-1.17, R-7.26, R-8.31 with a triage condition each, so the adapter's failures are fixed there and only product questions reach the product owner.

4 criterion(s) failed against the **old** target at http://localhost:4300, and nobody has sorted them yet.
Before any reaches the product owner, say which of them this project's own adapter caused. The adapter is
under `tests/adapters/old/`; read each one against it and against the test.

### R-1.10 · v1

An opportunity that is not a draft is rejected unless it carries a title of 1 to 200 characters, a teaser of at most 500 characters, a location, and a description of 1 to 10,000 characters.

- given: a member of public sector staff creating or editing an opportunity that is not a draft
- when: they submit it with a missing title, a title over 200 characters, a teaser over 500 characters, a missing location, or a description that is missing or over 10,000 characters
- then: the submission is rejected and the offending field is named in the response
- test: tests/acceptance/opportunities/R-1.10.spec.ts

### R-1.17 · v3

Each evaluation question on a Sprint With Us or Team With Us opportunity carries a question and a guideline of 1 to 1,000 characters, a maximum score of at least 1, a response word limit of 1 to 3,000, and an optional minimum score that must be lower than the maximum score; its position (0 to 100) is set by its place in the opportunity's list of questions and is never entered by the person. These limits are enforced when the opportunity is submitted for review or published, where a question outside them is refused and the offending field is named; saving the opportunity as a draft does not apply them, so a draft may be saved holding a question outside these limits.

- given: a member of public sector staff adding an evaluation question to an opportunity
- when: they submit a question or guideline outside 1 to 1,000 characters, a score below 1, a word limit outside 1 to 3,000, a position outside 0 to 100, or a minimum score equal to or above the question's score
- then: the submission is rejected and the offending field is named
- test: tests/acceptance/opportunities/R-1.17.spec.ts

### R-7.26 · v1

A page's body is written as marked-up text with an editor offering formatting shortcuts, a link to the guidance page, and image upload that places the uploaded image into the body.

- given: an administrator editing a page's body
- when: they use the image control to choose an image file
- then: the image is stored by the service and a reference to it is inserted into the body at the cursor, and the published page shows the image
- test: tests/acceptance/content/R-7.26.spec.ts

**the editor's image control stores the image, places a reference to it in the body, and the published page shows it** — failed

### R-8.31 · v1

Removing an attachment from an opportunity or a proposal, or deleting the opportunity or proposal it hangs on, withdraws every read path the file held through that association, and a file that no record refers to any longer is identifiable as detached so that stored content can be disposed of under the records-retention rule for procurement attachments, which is set outside this domain.

- test: tests/acceptance/files/R-8.31.spec.ts

**removing an attachment from an opportunity withdraws the read path the file held through that opportunity** — failed

```

## Triage conditions

One condition per line, one for every criterion the page lists, in exactly one of these forms:

- `adapter-wrong <ID>: <why>` — the criterion and the test are both fine, and this target's adapter
  is what failed: it read the wrong thing off the page, reported a control missing that the page
  does render, or answered empty where it never reached the page. `<why>` names what the adapter
  did wrong, specifically enough for the next binding run to fix it. The criterion is not touched.
  On an unbound row it sends the binding back to `bind-adapter` however often it has been sent.
- `product-question <ID>` — nothing in the evidence points at the adapter. The failure goes to the
  product owner, who decides whether the application, the criterion or the test is wrong. No text
  after the ID. On an unbound row, use it when the criterion itself looks suspect.
- `oracle-cannot <ID>: <why>` — only for a row listed as unbound, on the oracle's target: the
  oracle genuinely cannot be driven into, or observed in, the state the test needs without
  changing its code — the state sits behind an external identity provider, is reachable only
  through a link the application emails, or is enforced only by a browser-native dialog.
  `<why>` names that state and why the oracle cannot reach it. It closes the row, changes no
  criterion, and stands until the criterion's version changes. It is never a way to skip binding
  work: where the application offers the control under another label, behind a step or as
  another persona, the answer is `adapter-wrong`.

The ID is the criterion's own id exactly as `spec/criteria-index.json` spells it. A condition may
not span more than one line. When the evidence is genuinely unclear, it is a `product-question`:
a failure wrongly sent to the product owner is answered there, while one wrongly blamed on the
adapter comes back from the next binding run unchanged and costs a run to find out.
