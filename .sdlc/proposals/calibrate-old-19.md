# 1 criterion(s) fail against old: which of them is the application's fault, which the spec's, and which the test's?

**Recommendation.** Rule on R-8.12 with a calibration condition, so the next calibrate run can apply it.

1 criterion(s) failed against the **old** target at http://localhost:4300, with no ruling yet.
The tests are blind: they were written from the criteria alone, by an agent that never saw the
application. So a failure means one of exactly three things, and only you can say which:
the application is wrong, the criterion is wrong, or the test is wrong.

Rule on each one below. Until every failure carries a ruling, this question is asked again on
every calibration run.

### R-8.12 · v1

A request for a file the requester may not read is answered as not authorized, and so is a request for a file that does not exist — unless the requester is an administrator, who is told it was not found.

- given: an identifier that no stored file carries
- when: a vendor asks for it, and then an administrator asks for it
- then: the vendor is told they are not authorized and the administrator is told it was not found
- test: tests/acceptance/files/R-8.12.spec.ts

**a request for a file the requester may not read is answered as not authorized** — failed

```
Error: the upload of "not-shared.txt" was not stored: refused for its read-access statement: 503 {"database":["Database error."]}; refused for the length of its name: 503 {"database":["Database error."]}; refused for its size: 503 {"database":["Database error."]}; answered with a fault of the service: 503 {"database":["Database error."]}
```

## Calibration conditions

One condition per line, and exactly one of these forms:

- `defect-in-old <ID>` — the old application really does fail this and the criterion is right
  anyway. The test stands as written and the rebuild has to pass it; the criterion keeps a note
  saying so. No text after the ID.
- `spec-wrong <ID>: <corrected statement>` — the criterion misdescribes what the old application
  does. The statement is replaced and its version bumped, which marks the test stale so
  `derive-tests --stale` writes it again from the corrected criterion.
- `test-wrong <ID>: <why>` — the criterion is right and the test is not. The id goes to
  `tests/acceptance/redo.yaml` for `derive-tests` to redo, still blind, and `<why>` records what
  the test got wrong without describing how the application is built.

The ID is the criterion's own id exactly as `spec/criteria-index.json` spells it. `defect-in-old`
takes no text; the other two require a colon and text on the same line. A condition may not span
more than one line.
