# 1 criterion(s) fail against old: which of them is the application's fault, which the spec's, and which the test's?

**Recommendation.** Rule on R-1.17 with a calibration condition, so the next calibrate run can apply it.

1 criterion(s) failed against the **old** target at http://localhost:4300, with no ruling yet.
The tests are blind: they were written from the criteria alone, by an agent that never saw the
application. So a failure means one of exactly three things, and only you can say which:
the application is wrong, the criterion is wrong, or the test is wrong.

Rule on each one below. Until every failure carries a ruling, this question is asked again on
every calibration run.

### R-1.17 · v2

Each evaluation question on a Sprint With Us or Team With Us opportunity carries a question and a guideline of 1 to 1,000 characters, a maximum score of at least 1, a response word limit of 1 to 3,000, and an optional minimum score that must be lower than the maximum score; its position is set by its place in the opportunity's list of questions, which holds at most 100, and is never entered by the person; a question outside these limits is refused.

- given: a member of public sector staff adding an evaluation question to an opportunity
- when: they submit a question or guideline outside 1 to 1,000 characters, a score below 1, a word limit outside 1 to 3,000, a position outside 0 to 100, or a minimum score equal to or above the question's score
- then: the submission is rejected and the offending field is named
- test: tests/acceptance/opportunities/R-1.17.spec.ts

## Calibration conditions

One condition per line, and exactly one of these forms:

- `defect-in-old <ID>` — the old application really does fail this and the criterion is right
  anyway. The test stands as written and the rebuild has to pass it; the criterion keeps a note
  saying so. No text after the ID.
- `spec-wrong <ID>: <corrected statement>` — the criterion misdescribes what the old application
  does. The statement is replaced and its version bumped, which marks the test stale so
  `derive-tests --stale` writes it again from the corrected criterion.
- `test-wrong <ID>: <why>` — the criterion is right and the test is not. The id goes to
  `tests/acceptance/redo.yaml` for `derive-tests` to redo, still blind, and `<why>` records what
  the test got wrong without describing how the application is built.

The ID is the criterion's own id exactly as `spec/criteria-index.json` spells it. `defect-in-old`
takes no text; the other two require a colon and text on the same line. A condition may not span
more than one line.
